# Synthetic Medical Images from Dual Generative Adversarial Networks: A Solution to the Scarcity and Privacy of Medical Images in Deep Learning

This is the associated source code for our submission to the 2017 Siemens Science Fair Competition.

Our code is split into two sections: a geometry generating dcgan, and a photorealism generator using pix2pix.



To run the Stage-I GAN use: 

python geometry-main.py.

To run the Stage-II GAN use:

python pix2pix.py
